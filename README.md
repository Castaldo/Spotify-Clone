## Spotify Clone

The objective of this project was to create a user interface as similar as possible top Spotify's using the Spotify Web API. This projected is limited in scope as it is meant to only emulate the UI. You can use this app only to shift through songs on a hard coded playlists (my personal discover weekly).
